Midterm will cover THROUGH variance: The Lecture b/f the Normal Distribution

1. No "find a bug in this code" q's
2. No writing code q's
3. Some interpreting code q's

Example Probs: 
#4 on Notebook 11
	X is a cont RV, where f(x) = x/2 for 0 leq x leq 2 and 0 elsewhere
	What's the expected value? Guess: Where is most of the 'mass' of the graph? Near 2.
	E[X] = integral of xf(x)
	     = integral from 0 to 2 of x * x/2
	     = x^3 / 6 from 0 to 2
	E[X] = 4/3 <-- near 2

	Var(x) = integral of (x - mean)^2 f(x)
	    OR = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 <-- Easier
	
	What's E[Y], where Y = 2x + 3. Easy peasy: 
	E[Y] = 2(E[X]) + 3
	     = 2(4/3) + 3
	     = 17/3

	What's Var(Y)?
	Var(Y) = Var(2x + 3) // 3 can dissapear
	       = Var(2x) // 2 will be squared when pulled out
               = 2^2 Var(x)

For Box-and-Whisker Plots: 
	- Need quartiles, IQR
	- Finding Q1 and Q3, if odd number of data points include median in both halves
	- IQR is Q3 - Q1
	- Median line at Q2, box from Q1 to Q3, whiskers out to 
		data point leq (1.5*IQR + Q3) or (1.5*Q1 - IQR). 
		Flyers all points outside of whiskers.
	- Tada!

Scewed-ness: Q1 closer to Q2 than Q3 to Q2: pos scew

ALL THE DISTRIBUTIONS:
	Poisson: Discrete					Exp: Cont
		 Number of events in interval     		     Time intervals between events
		 Both use lambda (events per interval)		     pdf: lambda e^(-lambda t)
		 pmf: P(X=k) = (lambda^k e^(-lambda))/k!	     cdf: F(x) = 1 - e^(-labmda t) for x geq 0 else 0
		 cdf: fuck that					     Memoryless: time to first arrival is the same as time from first to second arrivals

Continuous Distri:
	Exp, Uniform, Normal

Disrete Distri:
	Discrete Uniform, neg binom, gemetric, poisson, bernoulli, binomial

Bernoulli: Ber(p)		Binomial: Binom(n, p)
	Single trial 			Number of successes in n trials
	Fixed p of success		Trials must be independent, have same p
	One coin flip			aka trials must follow Ber(p)

Geometric: Geo(p)				Neg Binom:
	Number of trials to first success		Number of trials to kth success
	Trials must be Ber(p)

Bayes Rule: Know it.
